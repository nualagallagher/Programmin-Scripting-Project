A project on Fisher's Iris Data Set

## Background Information on the Iris Data Set:
The Iris Flower Data Set also known as Fisher’s Iris Data Set was developed and introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. Fisher was a statistician and biologist. The data set consisted of 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The length and the width of the sepals and petals of each sample was measured in centimetres. Based on the results of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant/characteristic model to distinguish the species from each other (developed a characteristic spreadsheet which could be used to distinguish the species from each other).  Fisher first published his data set in his paper “The Multiple Use of Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”. 

With regards to the collection of the samples, two out of the three species (Iris setosa and Iris versicolor) were picked on the same day in the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada.  These species were gathered from the same pasture of grassland/colony and were measured by the same person (Dr. E. Anderson) at the same time using the same piece of equipment. The fact these two species were collected and measured by the same person on the same day results in consistency of measuring as another individual may have a had a different method of measuring the flowers. However, the colony in which these two species were found may differ from different colonies and eco-systems across the world and therefore these measurements cannot be used as an accurate representation of the length and width of the sepals and petals of an Iris flower. It should also be noted that the Iris versicolor was note collected from the same location as the other two species. This itself may have affected the overall results of the data set as Iris versicolor cannot be compared accurately to the other two species as it was not collected within the same vicinity. The ecosystem of different areas can affect the overall development of species and this itself would be relevant to the iris flower. The flower has a diverse eco system as it is generally found in dry, semi-desert, or colder rocky mountainous areas, but can also be found in grassy slopes, meadowlands, bogs and riverbanks. Most species of the flower can be found within the Northern Hemisphere, typically in North America, Europe and Asia.

## The Python Script:
To run the script to invesigate the Iris Data set you must have already downloaded Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Python (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). You must also download the Iris data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) and save the file as **Iris.csv**.

1. Please find the script in the file project.py within the Programmin & Scripting Project Depository. Copy this code.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (VSC), this is where the script will be ran. Create a new file in VSC and name in **project.py**. Paste the code into this and then save it (cntrl s).
3. To open the Integrated Terminal, click **View** and then click the **integrated terminal** or alternatively use the shortcut cntrl +'.
4. Type **iPython** into the Intergrated Terminal and press enter.
5. Once you have done this you will **"In [1]:"** appears below. Beside this type **run project.py** and press enter. This will return the mean, max and min of each measurement taken (sepal & petal lentgh and width). It will also produce Histograms reflecting same.
